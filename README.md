# EverLoader

EverLoader is a Windows app that helps you to load games onto a MicroSD card to be played on your Evercade™ using an EverSD cartridge.

## Scraping
When you add new games/roms to EverLoader, it will take care of scraping the game descriptions, box art images, banners and other information from the Internet using the TheGamesDB database.

## Sync with MicroSD
After you're done adding games, you can select the games you want to sync to a MicroSD card connected to your computer. EverLoader will copy the games and images in the right format to your MicroSD, so you can play them on your Evercade™ using an EverSD cartridge.

## How to run
EverLoader is a portable app, which means that after unzipping, you can run it from any drive or directory to which you have read/write access.
On usage, it creates a folder named 'everloader_data' alongside the EverLoader executable to hold all games, images and other information.

Enjoy!
