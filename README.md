# EverLoader

EverLoader is a Windows app that helps you to load games onto a MicroSD card to be played on your Evercade™ using an EverSD cartridge.

## 1. Adding and Scraping
When you add new games/roms to EverLoader (using the 'Add New ROMs' button), it will take care of scraping the game descriptions, box art images, banners and other information from the Internet using the online TheGamesDB database.

## 2. Editing Game Info
After you've added new games to EverLoader, you can edit all the game information, like Title, Descripton, Genre, Release data, but also the button mapping text. Besides that, you can upload custom box art or banners in case the scraper didn't find any images that you like. And in case nothing was scraped, you can try the 'Scrape by game title' option, which shows you a list of possible matches for you to choose from. In case multiple banners are found, you can pick the one you like and move the cut-out up or down.

## 3. Sync with MicroSD
After you're done editing the game information, you can select the games you want to synchonize to a MicroSD card connected to your computer. EverLoader will copy the games and images in the correct format to your MicroSD, so you can play them on your Evercade™ using an EverSD cartridge.

## EverLoader is Portable
EverLoader is a portable Windows app, which means that after unzipping, you can run it from any drive or directory to which you have read/write access.
On usage, it creates a folder named 'everloader_data' alongside the EverLoader executable to hold all games, images and other information.

Enjoy!
